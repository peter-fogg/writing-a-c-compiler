# Writing a C Compiler
I'm working through Nora Sandler's Writing a C Compiler in Rust. Goals are:

- To write a "proper" compiler -- I took a (bad) compilers class in
  college and didn't learn much. I ended up writing my course project
  in Haskell against my professor's advice, learned about parser
  combinators, and generated some very, very bad assembly. Then I took
  a compilers class at IU Bloomington writing a nanopass compiler in
  Scheme that, frankly, is a black hole to me despite the fact that it
  was a much better class and touched on some real aspects of codegen
  and optimization. I would like to remind myself of that experience.

- Learn Rust a bit better with a real project that feels more legit
    than "hello, world".

- Have a nice time I guess?
